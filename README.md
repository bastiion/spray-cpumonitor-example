# Spray.io CPU Monitor Example #

This is an example application demonstrating showing host CPU usage on a webpage using a
[websocket](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket).

**It's currently a work in progress...**

It shows the total system CPU usage and the JVM-process CPU usage the last 120 seconds for the host it runs on.

To see it in action now go here: [http://cpumon.herokuapp.com/](http://cpumon.herokuapp.com/)
It's running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) which will have the consequence of showing the total system CPU
usage for the server being affected by other unknown applications.

To trigger the JVM-process CPU usage to increase the following could be used to trigger it:
```
ab -k -c 10 -n 100 http://cpumon.herokuapp.com/
```
*Please be gentle though doing this since it's not very nice to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)*

The following were used building this example:
* [scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
* [spray.io](http://spray.io/)
* [spray-websocket](https://github.com/wandoulabs/spray-websocket)
* [angularjs](https://angularjs.org/)
* [n3-charts](https://github.com/n3-charts/line-chart)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
## Running ##
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
The easiest way to run this application is with the following command in the base directory:                                                                                                                                    
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
./activator run
```                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
After this it can be accessed from a web browser at **http://localhost:8080/**.
